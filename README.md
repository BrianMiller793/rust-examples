This repository is for examples of my struggles with learning the Rust
language.  At this time, the version is 1.23.

**minigrep**: An example of a command-line utility.  This modifies the code
from the example to use a function pointer in a structure.

**queens**: Yet another solution to the N-Queens problem.  This uses
constraints instead of back-tracking.

**philosophers**: A different take on the dining philosophers problem.  The
philosophers, according to the original word problem, enter and exit the
dining room.  Oh, and there's more philosophers than seats at the table.
