This repository is for examples of my struggles with learning the Rust
language.  At this time, the version is 1.23.

**minigrep**: An example of a command-line utility.  This modifies the code

**queens**: Yet another solution to the N-Queens problem.  This uses
constraints instead of back-tracking.
